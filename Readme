One SportsVu tracking file, play by play transcript (to find each 3pt shot time), python code to parse both types of files, 
PCA to examine variability across data features, svm for classification (make or miss).

Sportvu data is a report of player position for all 10 players and the basketball 25 times per sec with 1 ft accuracy. Each 1/25 sec is 
called a moment in the data.  Each game is 48 minutes which is about a 70-80MB JSON file.

launch.py runs prepare.py which uses the timestamps from the play by play to find the exact moment each shot was taken.
launch.py was designed to use multicores on a cluster so we could parse multiple games simultaneously.
For this project we had access to the Palmetto cluster at Clemson University.
